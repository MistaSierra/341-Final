I plan on making a simple portfolio page for myself showcasing a little of my work. I don't expect it to be super fancy. I don't plan on actually using it in future, I think when the the time comes I will use the general layout of the project. I won't write actual things in any large text involved. The concept of this site is more of a potential layout for future content.
